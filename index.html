                    My name is Victor Ivan Hernandez Barajas and I am a 3rd year at the University of California, Irvine. I am majoring in 
                    <u>Computer Science</u> and I aspire to become a Software Engineer after I graduate from college. Within Software Engineering,
                    I am interested in pursuing web development or mobile development since I enjoy creating easy to use interfaces.

                    I am originally from Mexico but moved to the US when I was 2 years old. Ever since then, I have been residing in San
                    Mateo, CA which is located in the bay area. I am a first-gen college student who will be the first in my family to graduate college
                    in my family. Im extremely proud of everything I have accomplished so far and I am hungry to learn new things.

                        Better Budget is a web application my team developed during my time in Google's Software Product Sprint. I developed the Rent vs Buy
                         calculator which is meant to better inform house buyers whether they should buy or rent a home depending on the time they plan to 
                         stay at the property. One of the most interesting features of Better Budget is that it is capable of translating all the text on 
                         the page into one of five different languages using Google's translate api. This makes access easier for non-english speakers so 
                         that they too can make use of Better Budget.

                <p>
                    Connect Four is a web application based game that is completely controlled with hand gestures. I used the Handtrack.js library to 
                    detect unique hand gestures that corresponded with a particular column. The game is started with two open hands and the red player always
                    starts the game. After the red player places its tile with two closed hands, the top tile is automatically switched to yellow indicating
                    that it is the yellow players turn. The game keeps going until there is a winner, which stops the game. The body of the html page changes its
                    color to the winning player's color.

                    Spotify API Website is a web application that displays Spotify's API service to populate Artist, Album, and Track data. The
                    user can make a search for a particular Artist, Album, or Track and the website will display all relevant information. For example,

                    Flashcards are created with pop ups and flashcards are saved to disk so that next time the user opens the app, then
